  title: Royal Mail Pro Shipping V2 REST API
  x-ibm-name: royal-mail-pro-shipping-v2-rest-api
  description: >-
    This API specification details the requirements for integrating with Royal Mail Pro Shipping V2 REST API. It specifically covers how the Royal Mail Pro Shipping API can be used by business customers to conduct
    shipping activity with Royal Mail and provides the technical information to
    build this integration. This specification must be used with the relevant
    accompanying specifications for customers wishing to interface their systems with Royal Mail services.
    
    
    Royal Mail Pro Shipping API exposes a fully RESTful service that allows account customers to create shipments, produce labels, and produce documentation for all the tasks required to ship domestic items with Royal Mail. Built on industry standards, Royal Mail Pro Shipping V2 API provides a simple and low cost
    method for customers to integrate with Royal Mail, and allows them to get
    shipping quickly.
    
    
    There are no costs to customers for using the Royal Mail Pro Shipping V2 API services, however customers’ own development costs must be covered by the customer developing the solution. Royal Mail will not accept any responsibility for these development, implementation and testing costs. Customers should address initial enquiries regarding development of systems for these purposes to their account handler.
